InnoDB: ###### Diagnostic info printed to the standard error stream
2023-07-11  9:29:57 0 [ERROR] [FATAL] InnoDB: Semaphore wait has lasted > 600 seconds. We intentionally crash the server because it appears to be hung.
230711  9:29:57 [ERROR] mysqld got exception 0x80000003 ;
This could be because you hit a bug. It is also possible that this binary
or one of the libraries it was linked against is corrupt, improperly built,
or misconfigured. This error can also be caused by malfunctioning hardware.

To report this bug, see https://mariadb.com/kb/en/reporting-bugs

We will try our best to scrape up some info that will hopefully help
diagnose the problem, but since we have already crashed, 
something is definitely wrong and this may fail.

Server version: 10.4.28-MariaDB source revision: c8f2e9a5c0ac5905f28b050b7df5a9ffd914b7e7
key_buffer_size=16777216
read_buffer_size=262144
max_used_connections=2
max_threads=65537
thread_count=5
It is possible that mysqld could use up to 
key_buffer_size + (read_buffer_size + sort_buffer_size)*max_threads = 20302 K  bytes of memory
Hope that's ok; if not, decrease some variables in the equation.

Thread pointer: 0x0
Attempting backtrace. You can use the following information to find out
where mysqld died. If you see no messages after this, something went
terribly wrong...
mysqld.exe!my_parameter_handler()
ucrtbase.dll!raise()
ucrtbase.dll!abort()
mysqld.exe!??$_Construct@$00PEBD@?$basic_string@DU?$char_traits@D@std@@V?$allocator@D@2@@std@@AEAAXQEBD_K@Z()

KERNEL32.DLL!BaseThreadInitThunk()
ntdll.dll!RtlUserThreadStart()
The manual page at https://mariadb.com/kb/en/how-to-produce-a-full-stack-trace-for-mysqld/ contains
information that should help you find out what is causing the crash.
